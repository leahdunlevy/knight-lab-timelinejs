Until we can figure out how to automate it, be sure to follow these steps to update the WP plugin for a TimelineJS update. Each separate step may not always apply, so use your judgment.

* in the TimelineJS project, run 'fab stage_wp' (this copies the latest TimelineJS into this repository)

* Update the list of available languages. Should be as simple as copy/paste the menu <option> items from 
    TimelineJS/website/templates/_make.html 
to 
    TimelineJS-Wordpress-Plugin/knightlab-timeline.php

* update readme.txt with release notes (as we develop style, document that explicitly right in this here file)

* (as we go through the process of updating the WP repository, document details here)
